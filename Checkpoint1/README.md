## Single Line Code Snippet
This is my single line of code. In Linux, to list all files and directories, use `ls -la`.

## Multi Line Code Snippet
This is my multi line code snippet. In order for Bash to display Hello World, use the following code in a text editor.

```
#!/bin/sh
# This is bash program to display Hello World
echo " Hello World "
```
